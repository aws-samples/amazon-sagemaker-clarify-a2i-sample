    "There are two major challenges being faced by customers looking to implement machine learning solutions in their line of business.    \n",
    "1. Machine learning models are getting more and more complex and opaque, which makes it harder to explain the predictions of such models.    \n",
    "2. Machine learning decisions lack the human understanding and collaboration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "These challenges prevent lot of customers from financial and healthcare industries to implement machine learning solutions in their business critical functions. Amazon Sagemaker clarify and Amazon Augmented AI(A2I) try to solve both of these challenges from different perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Clarify helps improve your machine learning models by detecting potential bias and helping explain how these models make predictions. The fairness and explainability functionality provided by SageMaker Clarify takes a step towards enabling AWS customers to build trustworthy and understandable machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Amazon A2I provides a way to introduce human review loop step in the machine learning inference pipeline. This greatly improves the trust and reliability in the machine learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this understanding, in this notebook, we will look at an example of how we can use both SageMaker Clariy and Amazon A2I at the same time in a single machine learning pipeline to improve transparency and introduce reliability in the inference workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the adult population dataset located at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/ to determine if a person's salary is greater than $50,000 or less than $50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the steps we will perform as part of this notebook:  \n",
    "1. Train and deploy an XGBoost model on the Adult population dataset predicting if the person's salary is greater than $50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run Batch inference on the model endpoint along with also running explainability analysis on the batch of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter the negative predictions as we are interested in knowing why the model predicted a person's salary to be less than $50,000 and which features had the most impact in that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot the SHAP values computed by SageMaker Clarify for those negative outcomes, to see which feature/s contributed the most in predicting the negative outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use A2I Human Review Workflow providing the prediction score and SHAP plot for the human reviewer to analyze the outcome to verify the feature attributions in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the reviewed data as groundtruth to be used for re-training purposes."
